Getting Started
Now it's time to learn the ASP.NET Core Mvc syntax. This requires more setup than NancyFx did, but it comes with a lot more power and versatility. As always, in order to configure your project we start with project.json:

{
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true
  },
  "dependencies": {
     "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
        "type": "platform",
        "version": "1.0.1"
      },
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "1.0.0",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc": "1.0.0"
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "dependencies": {}
    }
  }
}
After a dotnet restore we now have the Mvc tools available for our project. Configuration is not done yet though! We still have to tell our app to use these tools. Create a Startup.cs file and put the following code into it:

using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
namespace YourNamespace
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddMvc();
        }
    }
}
Program.cs will look the same as it did previously, go ahead and copy it over from an older assignment.
At its most basic that's all we need to activate the Mvc, however we still need to learn how to apply the new tools at our command.
